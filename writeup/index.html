    At the heart of this project, <strong> Team DASS</strong> (Divyansh, Ahmed, Subika, and Supriyaa) embarked on an exhilarating journey into the daily rhythms of life.  
    Drawing on a detailed 14-day record of mouse activity and ambient temperature, we set out to reveal how environmental cues, such as light, dark, and heat, shape behavior.  
    We invite you to dive in and uncover the hidden patterns that guide our curious subjects through each day and night!
  </p>
  <h2>Design Rationale</h2>

  <h3>1. Chart Type &amp; Visual Encodings</h3>
  <p>
    We wanted to show how mice activity and temperature co-vary over the 24-hour cycle, yet these two variables live on very different scales.
    A <strong>dual-axis line chart</strong> lets us overlay their trends without overwhelming the viewer.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Activity (steelblue)</strong> and <strong>Temperature (tomato)</strong> provide high contrast yet remain harmonious.</li>
    <li><strong>Day/night bands</strong> (lightyellow/grey) reinforce the circadian context without distracting from the data lines.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Alternatives considered:</em> heatmap (too busy), scatterplot (overplotting), small multiples (forced mental alignment).</p>

  <h3>2. Interaction Techniques</h3>
  <div class="table-responsive">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Control</th>
        <th>User Task</th>
        <th>Rationale &amp; Alternatives</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Play/Pause</strong></td>
        <td>Watch the full day’s activity unfold over time.</td>
        <td>Cinema-style animation; steps felt slower.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Scrubber slider</strong></td>
        <td>Jump straight to 6 PM (or any specific minute).</td>
        <td>More discoverable than clicking the axis directly.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Speed dropdown</strong></td>
        <td>Slow down the animation to inspect subtle dips.</td>
        <td>Options set via trial and error for 0.5×, 1×, 2× speeds.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Focus line &amp; tooltip</strong></td>
        <td>Read off exact values at the hovered time.</td>
        <td>Vertical line + floating tooltip is precise; axis labels would clutter.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Series checkboxes</strong></td>
        <td>Isolate one metric to reduce visual noise.</td>
        <td>Checkboxes are familiar; icon buttons lacked clear affordance.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Mouse dropdown selector</strong></td>
        <td>Select any individual mouse to view its specific activity and temperature patterns.</td>
        <td>A dropdown offers quick, reliable selection from the full set of mice; we considered a search box but with a limited number of subjects a simple dropdown proved most user-friendly.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </div>
  <p>
    Tick marks are at two-hour intervals to minimize clutter, and “midnight” replaces 0:00/24:00 to avoid ambiguity.

  <h2>Development Process</h2>

  <h3>Team Roles &amp; Time</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ahmed Ageel &amp; Supriya Chordia</strong> (3–4 hrs each): Brainstormed chart types, colors, and interactions; drafted project documentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Divyansh Kanodia &amp; Subika Haider</strong> (6–7 hrs each): Implemented D3 aggregation, dual axes, shading logic, and all interactive controls.</li>
  </ul>
  

  <h3>Workflow &amp; Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Version control &amp; collaboration via <strong>GitHub</strong>.</li>
    <li>Technologies: <strong> JavaScript (D3)</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.</li>
    <li>Local preview with VS Code Live Server; deployed on GitHub Pages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Challenges &amp; Learnings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The scrubber slider proved tricky: syncing with the playback timer, updating the focus line, and debouncing rapid input.</li>
    <li>Mobile layout largely works but we do need to tweak it to look more flawless and be a better, more user-friendly experience.</li>

  </ul>
